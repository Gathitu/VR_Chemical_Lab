# VR_Chemical_Lab

This is a showcase of an aplication that simulates physical Chenical lab experiences in VR.

Work involved:
- 3D Modelling and Texturing
- User Locomotion
- Grabbing of objects
- Liquid flow Physics
- Hinge and Sliding joints Physics
- Fire particles Physics
- UI in Screen-space overlay and in World-space
- Integration of Avatars in VR Controller
- Multi-user Networking
- Position and rotation synchronization of User's body avatar and scene Objects over a network
- Sound data synchronization over a network
