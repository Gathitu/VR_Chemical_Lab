# VR Chemical Lab

This is a showcase of an application that simulates physical Chemical lab experiences in VR.

Work involved:
- 3D Modelling and Texturing
- User Locomotion
- Grabbing of objects
- Liquid flow Physics
- Hinge and Sliding joints Physics
- Fire particles Physics
- UI in Screen-space overlay and in World-space
- Integration of Avatars in VR Controller
- Multi-user Networking
- Position and rotation synchronization of User's body avatar and scene Objects over a network
- Sound data synchronization over a network


This is how I progressed as I worked on the application:

**<p align="center">3. Multi-user Networking</p>**

In this video, you'll get to view the lab in Third-Person View
The networking entails Position and rotation synchronization of User's body avatar and scene Objects over a network.

**<p align="center">4. Overview of the whole application [Latest Version]</p>**

In this video, you'll get to view how the whole app works; setting User's details, connecting to another user's device in your LAN; and finally being immersed into the VR Chemical Lab where one can get to see and interact with other users.
